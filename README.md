# Maths-Expression-Generator

This is a small group coding challenge in a one of my classes. 

# Instruction 
Create a program that will compute arithmetic formulas to generate target values between 1 and 100 using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Your arithmetic formula _must use_ each of the following number _once and only once_: 1,2,3,4 and 5.

For example, the target value 15 can be reached by computing "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5" and this formula is valid because it uses each of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 exactly once. And while 15 can also be reached by computing "3 * 5", this formular is _invalid_ beause it did not use 1, 2, and 4.
